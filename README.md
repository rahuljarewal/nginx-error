# nginx-error
NGINX writes information about client requests in the access log right after the request is processed. By default, the access log is located at logs/access.log, and the information is written to the log in the predefined combined format. To override the default setting, use the log_format directive to change the format of logged messages, as well as the access_log directive to specify the location of the log and its format.
